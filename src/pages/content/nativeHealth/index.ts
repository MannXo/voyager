 * page-evidence check, and only a miss that survives both becomes an entry. A found report, a
 * withdrawal or `stop` clears the feature at once. Reports are ignored until `start`, which runs
 * only in Gemini's top frame.
 *
 * Entries and pending probes belong to the pathname they were reported on, `/u/<index>/` included.
 * Gemini navigates in place, so instead of listening for route changes the reporter compares the
 * pathname whenever it is read or reported to, and drops everything from a previous page. A
 * warning for one conversation or account never shows on another, and grace time never carries
 * over.
