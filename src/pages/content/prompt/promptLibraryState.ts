/**
 * Prompt Manager's copy of the prompt library (`gvPromptItems`) and every
 * change the panel makes to it. The panel renders `items` and calls these
 * methods; it never writes the library itself.
 *
 * Each change is sent as an op to the background owner, which applies it to
 * the library as stored at that moment, so an edit in another tab, a template
 * save, an import or a Drive merge is never written over.
 *
 * The panel shows `base` with its pending ops applied on top:
 * - `base` is the newest library seen in storage. `storage.onChanged` reports
 *   writes in the order they happened, so its last value is the newest; the
 *   first read only fills `base` if no change has arrived since it started.
 * - `pending` holds this tab's ops, in the order sent, until their replies
 *   come. A failed op just leaves, which is the rollback. The reply's list is
 *   never shown: it can be older than `base`. Storage's echo shows the write.
 * Every change to either recomputes the shown library. Ops are idempotent, so
 * reapplying one that `base` already holds changes nothing.
 *
 * Ops leave one at a time, each after the previous one's reply, so the owner
 * applies a tab's ops in the order the user made them even if the transport
 * would deliver two messages out of order. A reply that does not come within
 * `watchdogMs` marks the library unavailable: new edits are refused until it
 * comes, and nothing queued behind it is sent early.
