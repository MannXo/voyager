/**
 * Which conversation each turn on screen belongs to, for star writes.
 *
 * A turn belongs to the conversation the URL named when the turn entered the
 * page: a MutationObserver stamps every inserted node with the URL's id at
 * that moment, before any debounced refresh, and a turn takes the latest
 * stamp on itself or its ancestors. This is
 * proof only on hosts that change the URL before they render the next
 * conversation, which ChatGPT, Claude and DeepSeek were measured to do: a
 * host that renders B while the URL still names A gives B's turns to A.
 *
 * Nothing else grants ownership. Further rules only withhold it (the turn is
 * then unattributed and cannot be starred):
 *   - A new chat's turns (no id in the URL) are never starrable, not even
 *     under the id the chat later gets.
 *   - A turn inserted while another conversation's turn, or an unattributed
 *     one, is still on screen (connected and not under a hidden ancestor).
 *   - Before the route showed its own turns, new elements whose texts all
 *     appeared under the previous conversation (its thread remounting).
 * A turn keeps the owner it was first seen with, remembered per element in a
 * WeakMap.
