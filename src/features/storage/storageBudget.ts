/**
 * The background's one storage budget (DESIGN-v2 addendum P3P4 §0). Every
 * write that grows extension storage on behalf of several contexts (backup
 * copies, highlight commits, and later owner commits) is admitted and written
 * in one step of this chain, so two writers never both pass a check against the
 * same measurement. A step settles before the next starts, so a reservation
 * lives exactly as long as its write: there is no timed release (F1).
 *
 * The chain is separate from `writeQueue`: a queue turn may call `run`, but a
 * budget step never awaits the queue, and a step must never call `run` itself
 * (it would wait for its own step and hang).
