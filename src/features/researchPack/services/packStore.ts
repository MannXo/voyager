/**
 * Persistence for the research pack in `chrome.storage.local`.
 *
 * Scope: one pack per browser profile while account isolation is off, which
 * is what lets a user carry it from one conversation (or account) to the next.
 * When the user turns account isolation on for the platform, each account gets
 * its own pack under `buildScopedStorageKey`, matching how folders behave.
 * The pack is never synced to Drive or included in backups.
 *
 * Writes have a single owner: the extension background applies every tab's
 * ops through one `createResearchPackOwner` queue (see `packMessages.ts`).
 * chrome.storage has no compare-and-set, so two tabs each doing their own
 * read-modify-write would silently drop one tab's edit.
